# DynaBomber

- Created a UE4 C++ Project using the Top Down template (this avoids me having to recreate the wheel on some of the basic stuff, and gives me some base assets to work with)
- Removed point and click control and VR code
- Created new input method to limit movement to cardinal directions only
- Finished up movement and rotation code.
- Added second player and inputs for second player
